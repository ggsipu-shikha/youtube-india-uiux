Problem statement-Redesign YouTube’s comment section to dynamically reorganize in real-time based on what the user is seeing in the video—keeping it simple, readable, and relevant.

I am creating a smart comment experience that adapts in real-time to the video content, helping users discover insights, jokes, discussions, or reactions exactly when they matter. It works quietly under the video, enhancing the viewing and commenting experience.

CORE FEATURES 
1. Three Comment Modes (Filter Dropdown)

   Mode-Static Comments (Default)
   Description- Classic YouTube-style view. All comments, sorted by time or popularity.

  Mode-Live-Synced Comments
  Description- Comments update dynamically while the user watches the video, showing only those relevant to the current timestamp.

   Mode-Static Manual Timestamp Filter
   Description- Users pick a specific time on a slider and see comments tied to that exact moment.

2. Toggle for “Current Moment Only”
A toggle switch lets users control whether the full comment section shows:

All comments

Or only comments linked to the current video time

Helps focus user attention and avoid spoilers or off-topic discussions.

3. . Clean, Subtle UI Design
You’ve ensured:

All new UI elements (strip, toggle, labels) are:

Minimalist

Collapsible

Context-aware

Works well on both small screens (mobile) and desktop

Comments never float over the video—they sit below the player, keeping focus on the content


 INTERACTION EXPERIENCE (UX Flow)
User starts watching a video → sees normal comments

They enable Live Comments → relevant comments flow in automatically

Toggle: "Only show current moment comments" → deep filters comment section

User scrubs timeline → strip and comments adapt instantly

Switch to Manual Timestamp → picks a moment, reads what people said at that exact time


BIG IMPACT — SIMPLE INTERACTIONS

Element	                Why It’s Powerful

Toggle Filter-------	Gives full control to viewers without cluttering the UI
Live Comment Sync----	Feels intuitive and intelligent; connects users to real reactions in real time
Manual Filter----	Great for content-heavy videos (e.g., tutorials, speeches)
Timestamp Tags----	Turns every comment into a mini navigation tool
